Reflection for homework 2

1. f-Strings:
I used an f-string in my greet function: `return f"Hello {name}. How are you?"`
Now I understand that an f-string lets us directly insert variables into a string using {}.
For example:
    name = "Alex"
    print(f"Hello {name}")   # prints: Hello Alex

f-strings are useful because they are readable and flexible, especially when combining strings with variables.
However i do think i messed up when i did return then i did the print. it ends the code at return and me doing the print after it shouldnt work.

2. For-Loops and Lists:
In my code, I had:
    my_friends = ["Nicole", "Aryn", "Obi"]
    for friend in my_friends:
        print(greet(friend))

This loop goes through each item in the list (each friend’s name) and runs the greet function on it.
I did try doing for friend(s) in my_friends but saw that it was not working which i think i understood why but i am not sure on it.

3. Using Variables to Avoid Repeating Operations:
In my quadratic function, I used:
    discriminant = b**2 - 4*a*c

This was helpful because I used it in multiple places. If I hadn’t saved it to a variable, 
I would have had to type that expression three times

4. Comments:
Overall, i think i kind of understood the f strings but i do feel a bit confused on the math 
section. I am thinking of possibly going back to the recorded lectures again and try to see what is the confusing part or exactly what part of
the math i am struggling on.
